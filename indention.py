#Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
if 5 > 2:
  print("Five is greater than two!")

#The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, the most common use is four, but it has to be at least one.
if 5 > 2:
 print("Five is greater than two!") 
if 5 > 2:
        print("Five is greater than two!") 
#You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give you an error:
if 5 > 2:
 print("Five is greater than two!")
        print("Five is greater than two!")  
Syntax error!
