Let's analyze how many iterations of the for loop are required 
in the given scenario where nums = [2, 7, 11, 15] and target = 9.

When we iterate through the nums list using the enumerate function, 
the loop will perform the following iterations:

    For num = 2, the complement needed to reach the target (9 - 2 = 7) is not found in the dictionary, 
    so num_dict[2] = 0 is added to the dictionary.

    For num = 7, the complement needed to reach the target (9 - 7 = 2) is found in the dictionary at index 0, 
    so the loop terminates, and the result [num_dict[complement], i], which is [0, 1], is returned.

So, in this specific scenario, only two iterations of the for loop are required to find the match.

It's important to note that the efficiency of the algorithm can vary based on the input nums and target. In this case, the algorithm found a match relatively quickly because the numbers 2 and 7 were positioned in a way that their sum equals the target value 9.
